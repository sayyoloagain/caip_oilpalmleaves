# Object-Detection-of-Oil-Palm-Leaves

This is an object detection project. It is used to detect 3 types of oil palm leaves when the amount of magnesium used onto it.

<h1>Description</h1>
<b>Aim</b><br>
1. It is used to detect 3 types of oil palm leaves which are normal, excess and deficiency<br>

<b>Tools:</b><br>
	1. IntelliJ to write java code and execute it.<br>
	2. LabelImg to create datasets annotations for each classes.<br><br>
 
<b>Library:</b><br>
	1. The Deeplearning4j library were used to create this object detection project. 

<h1>Motivation of the idea</h1>

- We also inspired to do this object detection of oil palm leaves that can be integrated with drone in agriculture industry.
- This project also our CDLE capstone project.

<h1>Data Set Sources</h1>

- The data was collected from kaggle.com
- Image data are in .png
- 80% of the data was utilized for training, while 20% was used for testing.

<h1>Network Description</h1>
The architecture of Tiny-Yolo-v2, which consists of 9 convolutional layers, each with a leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) based activation function and batch normalization operation interspersed with 6 max-pooling layers and a region layer

<h1>Model Training</h1>
We used <b>Tiny-Yolo-v2</b> model.  Tiny-Yolo-v2 employs feedforward process for object detection.

<h1>Testing</h1>

<h1>Future Development</h1>

-More dataset for each class
-Oil Palm leaves on trees detection
- Can be integrated with drones for oil palm plantations.
